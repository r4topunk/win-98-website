## Notes for Implementation

### Core Principles

- **Reusability**: Gallery components work with any image array
- **Simplicity**: No complex metadata, focus on image display
- **Multi-window support**: Multiple galleries open simultaneously
- **Authentic Windows 98 UX**: Maintain retro aesthetic while improving usability

### User Workflow

1. Click desktop icon â†’ Opens gallery grid window
2. Click image in grid â†’ Opens image viewer window with navigation
3. Use Previous/Next to browse through images
4. Multiple windows can be open and resized as needed
5. Windows focus properly when clicked

This updated task list focuses specifically on your requirements: reusable image gallery components, clean window management, and intuitive multi-window interaction patterns.
