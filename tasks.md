# Windows 98 Artist Portfolio - Development Tasks

## Overview
This document outlines the development plan for a Windows 98-themed artist portfolio focused on creating an intuitive image showcase system. The emphasis is on building reusable image gallery components that work seamlessly within Windows 98-style windows, providing an authentic desktop experience with proper multi-window management and user interaction patterns.

## Phase 1: Core Image Gallery System

### 1.1 Reusable Image Gallery Components
**Concept**: Create modular components that can display image collections in Windows 98-style interfaces
**Target UX**: Grid-based image browsing with seamless navigation between collections and individual images

#### Core Tasks:
- [ ] **Image Gallery Grid Component** (`src/components/ImageGalleryGrid.tsx`)
  - Grid layout displaying image previews/thumbnails
  - Clean, minimal interface without redundant titles inside windows
  - Responsive grid that adapts to window size
  - Click interaction to open individual image viewer
  - Hover effects for better user feedback
  - Support for variable image aspect ratios

- [ ] **Image Gallery Viewer Component** (`src/components/ImageGalleryViewer.tsx`)
  - Full image display optimized for window viewing
  - Navigation controls (Previous/Next buttons)
  - Keyboard navigation support (Arrow keys, Esc to close)
  - Image counter display (e.g., "3 of 12")
  - Auto-scaling to fit window size while maintaining aspect ratio
  - Support for high-resolution image loading

- [ ] **Gallery Data Structure** (`src/data/galleries.ts`)
  - Simple image list interfaces
  - Image objects with src, alt, and optional title properties
  - Gallery collection groupings
  - No complex metadata - focus on display

#### Gallery Interface Design:
```typescript
interface GalleryImage {
  src: string;
  alt: string;
  title?: string;
}

interface ImageGallery {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  images: GalleryImage[];
}
```

### 1.2 Enhanced Window Management System
**Concept**: Improve window interactions with focus on multi-window workflows and usability
**Target UX**: Smooth, intuitive window management that supports multiple galleries open simultaneously

#### Core Tasks:
- [ ] **Resizable Windows** (update `Window.tsx`)
  - Add resize handles to all four corners and edges
  - Maintain minimum window sizes for usability
  - Constrain resizing within screen boundaries
  - Smooth resize animations and visual feedback
  - Remember window sizes per application type

- [ ] **Window Focus Management** (update `WindowContext.tsx`)
  - Click-to-focus behavior for overlapping windows
  - Visual indicators for active/inactive windows
  - Z-index management for proper window stacking
  - Automatic window focusing when opened
  - Taskbar integration for window switching

- [ ] **Improved Window Content Area** (update `Window.tsx`)
  - Remove redundant title display inside windows
  - Clean content area that maximizes image display space
  - Proper padding and margins for different content types
  - Seamless integration between window chrome and content

- [ ] **Multi-Window User Experience**
  - Cascade positioning for new windows
  - Smart positioning to avoid complete overlap
  - Window snapping to screen edges and other windows
  - Quick window arrangement shortcuts
  - Visual feedback during window interactions

### 1.3 Gallery Integration with Desktop Icons
**Concept**: Desktop icons that launch specific image galleries in dedicated windows
**Target UX**: Each desktop icon represents a different image collection

#### Core Tasks:
- [ ] **Gallery Desktop Icons** (update `desktop-icon.tsx` and `desktop.tsx`)
  - Configure existing desktop icons to launch image galleries
  - Pass specific gallery data to windows
  - Support for different gallery types (Photos, Artwork, Projects, etc.)
  - Icon-to-gallery mapping configuration

- [ ] **Window Content Router** (update `WindowContents.tsx`)
  - Route gallery data to appropriate components
  - Handle both gallery grid and image viewer windows
  - Support for opening viewer from grid selections
  - Clean separation between different content types

## Phase 2: User Interaction & Experience Enhancement

### 2.1 Advanced Gallery Navigation
**Concept**: Seamless navigation between gallery views and individual images
**Target UX**: Intuitive flow from grid browsing to focused image viewing

#### Core Tasks:
- [ ] **Gallery-to-Viewer Window Flow**
  - Clicking image in gallery opens new viewer window
  - Maintain reference to parent gallery for navigation
  - Support for multiple viewer windows from same gallery
  - Proper window positioning to avoid complete overlap

- [ ] **Image Navigation Controls** (within `ImageGalleryViewer.tsx`)
  - Previous/Next arrow buttons with Windows 98 styling
  - Keyboard shortcuts (Left/Right arrows, Home/End)
  - Wrap-around navigation (last image → first image)
  - Visual feedback for navigation state
  - Quick jump to first/last image

- [ ] **Gallery Context Management**
  - Track current image position in gallery
  - Handle dynamic gallery updates
  - Maintain navigation state across window interactions
  - Smooth transitions between images

### 2.2 Multi-Window User Experience
**Concept**: Optimize for users working with multiple gallery windows simultaneously
**Target UX**: Professional desktop workflow with multiple image collections

#### Core Tasks:
- [ ] **Window Focus & Selection**
  - Clear visual distinction between active and inactive windows
  - Smooth focus transitions
  - Click-anywhere-to-focus behavior
  - Keyboard shortcuts for window switching (Alt+Tab style)

- [ ] **Intelligent Window Positioning**
  - Smart cascade for new windows
  - Prevent windows from opening directly on top of each other
  - Screen edge snapping for organization
  - Window arrangement memory

- [ ] **Window Interaction Feedback**
  - Hover effects on window controls
  - Visual feedback during resize operations
  - Smooth animations for minimize/restore
  - Drag preview during window movement

### 2.3 Keyboard & Accessibility Support
**Concept**: Full keyboard navigation support for power users
**Target UX**: Complete functionality available without mouse

#### Core Tasks:
- [ ] **Gallery Grid Keyboard Navigation**
  - Arrow keys for grid navigation
  - Enter to open selected image
  - Tab navigation through UI elements
  - Escape to close/cancel operations

- [ ] **Image Viewer Keyboard Controls**
  - Arrow keys for image navigation
  - Space bar for next image
  - Escape to close viewer
  - Number keys for quick jump (1-9)

- [ ] **Window Management Shortcuts**
  - Alt+F4 to close windows
  - Alt+Space for window menu
  - Windows key shortcuts where appropriate
  - Tab order for window controls

### Data Flow Architecture
```
Gallery Selection Flow:
1. Desktop Icon Click → Open Gallery Grid Window
2. Gallery Grid renders images from passed gallery data
3. Image Click → Open Gallery Viewer Window with full gallery context
4. Viewer handles navigation within the gallery collection
5. Multiple viewers can reference same gallery data

Window Management Flow:
1. Window Context tracks all open windows
2. Focus management handles active/inactive states
3. Position management prevents overlap conflicts
4. Resize system maintains usability constraints
```
