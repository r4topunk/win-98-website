# Windows 98 Artist Portfolio - Development Tasks

## Overview
This document outlines the development plan for an authentic Windows 98-themed artist portfolio. The focus is on creating a hybrid solution that maintains true Windows 98 UI patterns while ensuring excellent performance on both desktop and mobile devices. The approach avoids modern gallery concepts that didn't exist in Windows 98, instead embracing the authentic file-based navigation and window management of the era.

## Phase 1: Authentic Windows 98 Foundation

### 1.1 File Explorer Based Content System
**Concept**: Replicate how Windows 98 actually handled images and media - through file explorer windows, not modern galleries
**Target UX**: Users navigate folders, double-click files to open them in appropriate applications

#### Core Tasks:
- [ ] **File Explorer Component** (`src/components/FileExplorer.tsx`)
  - Classic Windows 98 file list view (icon view, list view, details view)
  - Folder navigation with back/forward buttons
  - Address bar showing current folder path
  - Status bar with file count and selection info
  - Right-click context menus for files and folders

- [ ] **File System Data Structure** (`src/data/filesystem.ts`)
  - Hierarchical folder structure (e.g., `/Portfolio/Paintings/2024/`)
  - File metadata (name, type, size, date modified)
  - Support for different file types (images, videos, documents)
  - Thumbnail cache for image files

- [ ] **File Type Handlers**
  - **Image Viewer** (`src/components/ImageViewer.tsx`): Windows 98 style image viewer
  - **Media Player** (`src/components/MediaPlayer.tsx`): Windows Media Player inspired interface
  - **Text Viewer** (`src/components/TextViewer.tsx`): Notepad-style text display

### 1.2 Authentic Window Management
**Concept**: Windows behave exactly like Windows 98 - multiple overlapping windows, taskbar, proper window controls
**Target UX**: Classic desktop metaphor with authentic interactions

#### Core Tasks:
- [ ] **Enhanced Window Component** (update `Window.tsx`)
  - Proper window chrome (title bar, borders, resize handles)
  - Window controls (minimize, maximize/restore, close)

  - Authentic Windows 98 desktop icons
  - Single-click to select, double-click to open
  - Icon spacing and grid alignment
  - Desktop right-click context menu

### 1.3 Classic Application Framework
**Concept**: Each content type opens in its own "application" window with appropriate UI
**Target UX**: Authentic software applications from the Windows 98 era

#### Core Tasks:
- [ ] **Application Templates**
  - Paint-style interface for image viewing
  - Explorer-style interface for folder browsing

  - Context-sensitive menu items
  - About dialogs for each application

## Phase 2: Mobile-Responsive Windows 98

### 2.1 Adaptive Window Behavior
**Concept**: Windows 98 interface that intelligently adapts to mobile screens without losing authenticity
**Target UX**: Touch-friendly Windows 98 that feels natural on mobile

  - Mobile: Windows expand to near full-screen automatically
  - Tablet: Traditional windowed interface with touch-friendly controls
  - Desktop: Classic overlapping windows behavior
  - Window controls sized for touch targets (44px minimum)

- [ ] **Touch-Enhanced File Explorer** (update `FileExplorer.tsx`)
  - Larger file icons for touch selection
  - Touch-friendly scrollbars
  - Tap to select, double-tap to open
  - Touch-and-hold for context menus
  - Swipe gestures for back/forward navigation

- [ ] **Mobile Taskbar** (update `Taskbar.tsx`)
  - Bottom-positioned taskbar for thumb reach
  - Larger taskbar buttons for touch
  - Swipe up gesture to access Start menu
  - Auto-hide behavior in full-screen apps

### 2.2 Responsive Desktop Layout

  - Icon size adapts to screen density
  - Flexible grid layout maintaining proper spacing
  - Portrait mode: vertical icon arrangement
  - Landscape mode: traditional grid layout

- [ ] **Adaptive UI Components** (`src/components/ResponsiveUI.tsx`)
  - Scalable window chrome and controls

#### Core Tasks:
- [ ] **Image Optimization System**
  - Multiple image sizes (thumbnail, preview, full)
  - WebP format with JPEG fallbacks
  - Lazy loading for large file lists
  - Progressive image enhancement

- [ ] **Virtual Scrolling** (`src/components/VirtualList.tsx`)

### Performance Budget
- Gallery thumbnails: < 50KB each
- Full images: < 2MB each
- Video previews: < 10MB each
- Page load time: < 3s on 3G

### Windows 98 Aesthetic Balance
Maintain nostalgic charm while ensuring modern usability:
- Use Windows 98 styling for UI chrome
